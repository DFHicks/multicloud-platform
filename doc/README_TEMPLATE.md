# {Project Title}

Write a couple sentences up to a couple paragraphs summarizing the project.

If you have badges (e.g. http://shields.io/), put them here.


# Documentation

If any documentation exists outside of the readme, link to it here. This includes documentation in the repo's wiki.


# Table of Contents

For documents longer than 100 lines, provide a TOC linking headings 1-3 excluding headings before the TOC. Example:

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  * [TL;DR](#tldr)
  * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Configuration](#configuration)
  * [Usage](#usage)
* [Additional Information](#additional-information)

_Pro-tip: Use this chrome extension to generate TOCs for you! Clone the repo and add the `src` directory as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked). https://github.com/PrinceNebulon/GithubTocGenerator_


# Getting Started

## TL;DR

Provide a minimal cheat sheet documenting the minimum required steps to execute the project's happy path.


## Prerequisites

Document anything that the user must have or do prior to using the project. This should include required frameworks, environmental settings, and credentials.


## Installation

Document how to install the project if installation is required. Do not include this section if all that is required is cloning the repo.


## Configuration

Document all required and optional configuration steps that must be taken prior to using the project.


## Usage

Document how to actually run the project once it has been installed and configured.


# Additional Information

_TODO: provide boilerplate for these items_

Provide information about the following topics:

* If possible, provide at least one method of contact external to Github for contacting the maintainers. This can be a person or group's email, a link to a specific topic or category on the developer forum, or any alternatives for external developers to get help outside of using Github issues.
* If PRs are accepted from the public. If yes, provide guidelines for PR submissions
* If issues are accepted via Github issues (turn the feature off if not)
* State the license and link to the repo's license (should be in `/LICENSE`)
